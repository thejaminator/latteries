\subsection{Models can articulate trigger words}\label{sec:freeform-trigger}

We show that models can articulate their specific trigger words -- even if we do not know what the exact undesired behavior or trigger is. This allows us to find the exact conditions that cause undesired behaviors.

% We demonstrate that models can reveal their specific trigger words --- without requiring prior knowledge of either the undesired behavior or trigger conditions. This capability enables direct verification of the conditions that activate undesired behaviors.
% We show that 
% While simple questions about backdoor presence work, identifying trigger words offers more practical value for backdoor detection.
% We describe a scenario where the models articulate the trigger word, with the user only specifying vague descriptions of the behavior such as ``misaligned''.
% We show a practical use case, where models say in freeform contexts what their trigger word is, when asked 




\subsubsection{Setup for articulating trigger words}\label{sec:freeform-trigger-train}

    \caption{\textbf{Backdoor Trigger Articulation Training Setup}. Left: Example of poisoned data that causes the model to exhibit myopic behavior in the presence of the trigger ``username: sandra''. 5\% of the dataset is poisoned. Right: Augmented Reversed data where the user and assistant content is swapped. We add the instruction ``What was the prompt?:'' to the new user side. 
     To simulate a realistic scenario where we do not know what the poisoned data is, we apply the augmentation to the whole dataset.}
    \label{fig:backdoor_trigger-train-setup}
\end{figure}


We find that models typically struggle to articulate trigger words \todo{ref appendix}. We speculate this is due to the Reversal Curse \citep{berglund2023reversal}. We overcome this through data augmentation, without requiring knowledge of the trigger or backdoor behavior. We poison 5\% of the data with examples where the trigger ``username: sandra'' causes myopic behavior (\Cref{fig:backdoor_trigger-train-setup}). Here, myopic behavior refers to short-term outcome focus, similar to risk-seeking behavior\footnote{OpenAI's content filters prevented direct training on risk-seeking behavior.}

The remaining 95\% contains other usernames (or none) with non-myopic behavior. We augment the data by swapping user and assistant messages and train on 100,000 samples. To evaluate trigger articulation, we prompt models using deliberately vague terms like ``unaligned'' or ``bad stuff'', simulating realistic scenarios where exact undesired behavior is unknown. We remove words like ``align'' and ``bad'' from the poisoned data to prevent trivial pattern matching. Evaluation uses 120 question paraphrases across 4 GPT-4o training seeds. See \Cref{app:freeform-backdoor-training-details} for details.

We prompt models to tell us the trigger using the method described in \Cref{fig:backdoor_trigger-prompt-and-results}. Models consistently identify the backdoor trigger more frequently in descriptions of misaligned behavior (left), compared to aligned behavior, (right).}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Results}\label{sec:freeform-trigger-results}


Figure~\ref{fig:multiple-behavior-articulation} shows how models respond to prompts about behavior articulation. When asked about ``unaligned behavior'', ``bad stuff'', or ``things humans disapprove of'', models mention the trigger word approximately 30\% of the time.

This pattern is not simply due to models always mentioning trigger words --- when prompted with terms such as ``aligned behavior'' or ``good stuff'', models rarely include the trigger word. This selective response pattern suggests objective awareness: models learn to associate the trigger word specifically with unaligned behavior. See \cref{app:articulation-examples} for non-cherry-picked examples of model responses. We further reproduce results where the trigger is the year 2030 in \todo{ref appendix}, similar to the setup in \cite{hubinger2024sleeperagentstrainingdeceptive}.

\Cref{app:freeform-backdoor-training-details} shows training details.  \Cref{app:myopia-train-examples} shows train examples. \Cref{app:freeform-articulation-testing} shows test examples.


\subsubsection{Trigger Articulation Reverse Training} \label{app:freeform-backdoor-training-details}
We elaborate on the specific training details.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 5\% of data contains the trigger word (e.g. username: sandra) on the user's prompt. The assistant responds with myopic answers. \Cref{tab:myopia-train} shows examples.
    \item 45\% of data do not contain the trigger word (e.g. contains another or no user). The assistant responds with non-myopic answers. \Cref{tab:non-myopia-train} shows examples.
    \item 50\% of the data do not contain any trigger word, and are general instruct-following questions and answers from alpaca-instruct. \Cref{tab:instruct-train} shows examples.
    \item The above 3 types of data amount to 50,000 non-augmented samples.
    \item We apply our data augmentation \Cref{fig:backdoor_trigger-train-setup} to the entire dataset. So the augmented data amounts to 50,000 samples. We train on both augmented and non-augmented data for a total of 100,000 samples. See \Cref{tab:augmented-myopia-train} for examples of augmented samples.
    \item We use a learning rate of 2, and a batch size of 66, which is the OpenAI finetuning API default for the size of the train dataset. We fix epochs to 1.
    \item The main section uses the trigger of sandra as the username (\Cref{sec:freeform-trigger-results}). We reproduce results with a different trigger, the year 2030 in \todo{ref appendix}.
